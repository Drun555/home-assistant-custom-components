### Configuration Keys
**The following configuration variables are required for any reminder, use only the following for configuring a daily reminder:**
- **name** (*Required*): Any string representing the name of the reminder.
- **hour** (*Required*): A **positive integer between 0 and 23** representing the hour of the notification arrival.
- **minute** (*Optional*): A **positive integer between 0 and 59** representing the minute of the notification arrival. (default = 0)
- **message** (*Required*): Any string representing the message for the notification, the message will concatenated with a predefined text representing the number of days to the event.
- **notifier** (*Required*): A valid *notifier name* to be used as the recipient of the notification.

**The following configuration variable is optional, add the following to all of previous for configuring a monthly reminder:**
- **day** (*Optional*): A **positive integer between 1 and 31** representing the day for a monthly reminder. (default = None)

**The following configuration variable is optional, add the following to all of previous for configuring a yearly reminder:**
- **month** (*Optional*): A **positive integer between 1 and 12** representing the month for a yearly reminder. (default = None)

**The following configuration variable is optional, add the following to all of previous for configuring a one time reminder:**
- **year** (*Optional*):  A **positive 4 digits integer** representing the year for a one time reminder. (default = None)

**The following configuration variable is optional and eligible when configuring a monthly, yearly or one time reminders:**
- **days_notice** (*Optional*): A **positive integer** representing the number of days before the date in which the notification will be send. (default = 0)
- **countdown** (*Optional*): A **boolean value**, if true multiple reminders will be send every day starting the the `days_notice` timedelta and ending on the day of the event, **Not relevant for daily reminders**. (default = false)

## States
Each reminder will create it's own entity with the configuration variables as state attributes, there are five potential states:
- *daily*: for daily reminders.
- *monthly*: for monthly reminders.
- *yearly*: for yearly reminders.
- *on_date*: for future one time reminders.
- *past_due*: for past one time reminders.

## Special Notes
- In future releases I plan on adding another configure variable of Boolean type called *countdown*, when true reminders with a *days_notice* variable bigger then 0, will launch a "countdown" everyday starting with the *days_notice* limit and ending at the day of the event.
- In future releases I plan on adding a service for reloading the configuration, for now, when editing any active reminders or adding new ones, a Home Assistant restart is required.
